# BSQ-epitech2022
Biggest square project from Epitech

This is my BSQ project
The goal is to find the biggest square in a map given or generated

The square is made of 'X', obstacles are 'o' and empty space are "."

Very fun project where it challenged my algorithmic skills and coding style rigor.

USAGE :

./bsq mouli_maps/[choose_a_map] > test.txt 
(It will create a test.txt file which you can "cat" to see the content and find the square)

./bsq 10 "...ooo..." 
(It will generate a map thats 10 in length, and will add the pattern "...ooo..." until it reaches the length desired)
